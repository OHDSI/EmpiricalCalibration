#' Incidence rate ratios from Self-Controlled Case Series
#'
#' A dataset containing the incidence rate ratios (and standard errors) produced using a Self-Controlled Case
#' Series (SCCS) design. The outcome is upper GI bleeding, the drug of interest (groundTruth = 1) is sertraline.
#' Also included are 45 negative control drugs, for which we believe there to be no causal relation with upper
#' GI bleeding.
#' 
#' We used a database of medical records from general practices in the USA, the General Electric 
#' (GE) Centricity database, which contains data on 11.2 million subjects. We restricted  on study period 
#' (start of 1990 through November 2003), age requirements (18 years or older), available time prior to event 
#' (180 days), and risk definition window (30 days following the prescription).
#' Time 30 days prior to the first prescription was removed to account for possible contra-indications. Cases of upper GI bleeding were identified on the basis of the occurrence of ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the 
#' problem list. These codes pertain to esophageal, gastric, duodenal, peptic, and gastrojejunal ulceration, 
#' perforation, and hemorrhage, as well as gastritis and non-specific gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
#' 
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item drugName. Name of the drug
#'   \item groundTruth. Whether the drug is a positive (1) or negative (0) control
#'   \item logRr. The log of the incidence rate ratio
#'   \item seLogRr. The standard error of the log of the incidence rate ratio
#' }

#' Odds ratios from a case-control design
#'
#' A dataset containing the odds ratios (and standard errors) produced using a case-control design. 
#' The outcome is upper GI bleeding, the drug of interest (groundTruth = 1) is sertraline.
#' Also included are 46 negative control drugs, for which we believe there to be no causal relation with upper
#' GI bleeding.
#'

#' (start of 1990 through November 2003), age requirements (18 years or older), available time prior to event 
#' (180 days), number of controls per case (6), and risk definition window (30 days following the prescription).
#' Controls were matched on age and sex. Cases of upper GI bleeding were identified on the basis of the 
#' occurrence of ICD-9 diagnosis codes in the problem list. These codes pertain to esophageal, gastric, 
#' duodenal, peptic, and gastrojejunal ulceration, perforation, and hemorrhage, as well as gastritis

#' Relative risks from a new-user cohort design
#'
#' A dataset containing the relative risks (and standard errors) produced using a new-user cohort design. 
#' The outcome is acute liver injury, the drug of interest (groundTruth = 1) is Isoniazid
#' Also included are 30 negative control drugs, for which we believe there to be no causal relation with acute
#' liver injury.
#' 
#' We used the Thomson MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Beneficiaries database, which contains data on 
#' 4.6 million subjects. We selected two groups (cohorts): (1) all subjects exposed to isoniazid and 
#' (2) all subjects having the ailment for which isoniazid is indicated, in this case tuberculosis, 
#' and having received at least one drug that is not known to cause acute liver injury. We removed all
#' subjects who belonged to both groups and subjects for which less than 180 days of observation time 
#' was available prior to their first exposure to the drug in question. Acute liver injury was identified 
#' on the basis of the occurrence of ICD-9-based diagnosis codes from inpatient and outpatient medical 
#' claims and was defined broadly on the basis of codes associated with hepatic dysfunction, as have been 
#' used in prior observational database studies. The time at risk was defined as the length of exposure + 30 
#' days, and we determined whether subjects experienced an acute liver injury during their time at risk. 
#' Using propensity score stratification, the cohorts were divided over 20 strata, and an odds ratio over
#' all strata was computed using a Mantel-Haenszel test. The propensity score was estimated using Bayesian 
#' logistic regression using all available drug, condition, and procedure covariates occurring in the 180 
#' days prior to first exposure, in addition to age, sex, calendar year of first exposure, Charlson index,
#' number of drugs, number of visit days, and number of procedures.
#' 
#' The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item drugName. Name of the drug
#'   \item groundTruth. Whether the drug is a positive (1) or negative (0) control
#'   \item logRr. The log of the relative risk
#'   \item seLogRr. The standard error of the log of the relative risk
#' }
