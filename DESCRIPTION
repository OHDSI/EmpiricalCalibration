Description: Routines for performing empirical calibration of observational
    study estimates. By using a set of negative control hypotheses we can
    estimate the empirical null distribution of a particular observational
    study setup. This empirical null distribution can be used to compute a
    calibrated p-value, which reflects the probability of observing an
    estimated effect size when the null hypothesis is true taking both random
    and systematic error into account.
