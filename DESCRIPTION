Description: Routines for performing empirical calibration of observational
  study estimates. By using a set of negative control hypotheses we can
  estimate the empirical null distribution of a particular observational
  study setup. This empirical null distribution can be used to compute a
  calibrated p-value, which reflects the probability of observing an
  estimated effect size when the null hypothesis is true taking both random
  and systematic error into account. A similar approach can be used to
  calibrate confidence intervals, using both negative and positive controls.
